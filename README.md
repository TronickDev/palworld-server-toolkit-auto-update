## FAQ

- Copy Player will transfers the character and all its pals on your team and in your inventory, items on the character, and progress. It does not transfer map objects, items in chests and pals working at your base. Move items into your inventory / pals into your team if you want to transfer them.
- The save files are usually located at C:\Users<username>\AppData\Local\Pal\Saved\SaveGames<SteamID><Original Server Folder> for co-op saves.
- For `Xbox Game Pass` Player, save files are usually located at `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Packages\ PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\SystemAppData\wgs`
- For server saves, go to the dedicated server's file location through steam.
- u need at least 3 files to complete the transfer:
	- The source player character save file in Players folder
	- The source world's `Level.sav` file
	- The target world's `Level.sav` file
- For co-op saves, the player character save file is always `000000...001.sav`
- For another server saves, their `ID` will not change between worlds, so that have the same name in target server, you only need the source world's `000000...000.sav`
- Windows User present use `Windows Terminal` instance of `cmd` for color
